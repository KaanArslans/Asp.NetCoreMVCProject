// since Statuses enum is under different folder therefore different namespace,
// we need to include the namespace with using (similar to import in Java)

    // Way 1: we can use the Statuses enum type through its namespace

    // Way 2: we can use the Statuses enum type directly after adding the using line by its namespace on top of the file
